# Blur Control Center but Lighter!⚡ on HyperOS 2 emerald
## 📘 About

**Control Center Blur for HyperOS2 but LIGHTER** is a lightweight mod that brings back the blur (frosted glass) effect to the Control Center, Notification Shade, and Volume Panel in HyperOS 2 — designed to be smooth, minimal, and clean.
